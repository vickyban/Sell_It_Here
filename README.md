## Project Overview

Our team has come up with a web application that will facilitate the buying and selling of items in a specific community. The purpose of our project is to help potential users to advertise and generate earnings from selling their products. Moreover, connecting people within the community is also one of our concern that is why every product will be sorted according to their location and will be sold only within the area.

Strictly, users should create their account in order for them to use our services. Without an account, a user can only browse in our application.  This is to ensure that they are legitimate, for them to be able to modify their account, and for us to gather their information that we need as a requirement for the system to run its processes. After account creation, they can sell their product in our application by uploading and filling up all necessary details of their item. On the other hand, our homepage would have advertisements and search feature where users can use to look for the items they are interested in. The item that they can buy would be determined by how much money they have in their account which they can load up in their profile page. Once an item is sold, the system will notify the seller and will update the buyer&#39;s account balance and the seller&#39;s item in the inventory.



## Functional Requirements - Update

Our system features are:

- Sign up

In order for the users to sell and buy items on our application, they must create an account.

- Login

After an account is created user should log in in order to buy or sell products.

- Edit profile

The user can edit their information, add funds to their account wallet, and upload the product they are selling.

- Add fund

The user will be asked for their account no, Card Verification Value, and the amount they want to load to their account.

- Sell item

This is located in their profile and will be used to upload the product they are selling. In order to complete this area, all required information field must be filled up.

- Transaction History

This section will show the user about their transactions history whether they bought or sold a product.

- Search item

A search bar will be placed on our homepage where the user can look up for the stuff they are interested in buying. All items that will be shown to the user will be sorted according to the community they are in. For instance, a user who searched for a product is from Toronto, only products whose sellers are from Toronto will show in the search result.

- Buy item

The search result will show the user the product that they are looking for together with the price, and the name of the seller. When the user has decided which one to buy, they will be redirected to product information. A buy button is placed under the product information and once clicked will redirect them to the confirmation page then show them the receipt and their updated account balance.



Modification:

In edit profile , we removed the add fund to their wallet event and the upload product they are selling. Instead, we made a new page for the user to upload their product so that the profile is just specifically for the user&#39;s information.

We removed inbox and added messaging. A message box is located in every product the user will view unless they are the one selling the product. Every user has a message tab where they can view all their messages. Messages that were bolded means it hasn&#39;t been viewed yet. They can reply to that message by clicking the message body.

Search bar is not located in homepage anymore. On our homepage, the users will see the most recent posted products and category links which when clicked will show all the active products of that category on a page where the search bar is located on the header part.
